# Chinese Monetary Policy Shocks and ASEAN-5 Exchange Rates: A Daily Event Study

Code, cleaned-data workflow, and draft materials for my master's thesis on
whether Chinese monetary policy shocks generate measurable short-run effects in
ASEAN-5 (Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore) exchange rates.

## Research question
Do Chinese monetary policy shocks generate measurable short-run effects in
ASEAN-5 exchange rates?

## Design
Daily event study. Main sample 2008--2020 (full data 2006--2020). Dependent
variable: daily FX log return, local currency per USD. Preferred window
`[0,+1]`; benchmark `[0]`. Main shock `shock_1y`; robustness `shock_5y`.
Model progression: country OLS → pooled OLS → country fixed effects →
fixed-effects heterogeneity (interactions, Indonesia as reference).

## How to run
1. Open the project via the `.Rproj` file (sets the working directory).
2. Install packages once (listed at the top of `R/00_setup.R`).
3. `source("run_all.R")` to rebuild `data-clean/` and `output/` from scratch.

Scripts can also be run individually in numbered order; each sources
`00_setup.R` first.

## Status
Cleaned FX and shock data, merged estimation panel, and all baseline, pooled,
fixed-effects, and heterogeneity models are in place. Preliminary tables and a
coefficient figure are generated. Rough draft under revision.

surprises); see `docs/source_log.md`.
